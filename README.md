in AISec_Phishing_SVM file we performed SVM ON phishing dataset of urls and achieved 93% accuracy and also we performed logistic regression on sms_spam and phishing dataset of url and achieved 84% and 94% accuracies respectively.

In AISec_Lab4(Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic with K-means clustering) we did  k-means clustering on kddcup.data_10_percent file which doesnt has labels, thus k-means clustering is used for unsupervised clustering.
importing necessary supporting docs is mandatory to run the program without which it may give an error.We also have to import pyspar and hadoop.
